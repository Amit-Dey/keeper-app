# Keeper App
This is a React app that allows users to take notes and store them in text format. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for creating, editing, and deleting notes. The app is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, with features that resemble popular note-taking apps like Google [Keep](https://keep.google.com/).

## Features
- **Create new notes:** Users can create new notes by clicking on a button in the app. The app will open a new note editor where the user can type in their note.
- **Edit notes:** Users can edit existing notes by clicking on the note they want to edit. The app will open the note editor with the selected note's content.
- **Delete notes:** Users can delete notes by clicking on the delete button located next to each note.
- **Archive notes:** Users can archive notes by clicking on the archive button located next to each note. Archived notes are moved to a separate page where users can view or restore them later.
- **Search notes:** Users can search for specific notes by typing in keywords or phrases in the search bar located at the top of the app.
